## Project Description
The "Image Gallery" website is the final project of TIW-Informatic Technologies for the Web, course of Computer Science & Engineering held at Politecnico di Milano (accademic year 2023/2024).
It is a web application that allows users to manage an image gallery. Users can register, log in, upload images, create albums, and comment on images. 
The application was initially developed in pure HTML and later extended with JavaScript to enhance interactivity and user experience.

## Key Features
- **Registration and Login**: Users can register and log in through dedicated forms.
- **Image Management**: Users can upload images, which are stored in the server's file system.
- **Albums**: Users can create albums and associate images with multiple albums.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on images, with the ability to view and manage comments.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple navigation between the home page, albums, and image pages.
- **Custom Sorting**: Users can reorder images within an album according to their preferences.
